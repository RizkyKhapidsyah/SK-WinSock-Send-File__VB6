SendFile Demo project
=====================
This project demonstrates how to send a file to a remote
computer using the Winsock control.One side is the
server and the other is the client.Only the server can
send a file to the client.The client is then promted if
he wants to accept the file.Before the server sends the
file,there has to be a connection .If you are server,
click "HOST" to listen for incoming connections.When
the client connects to you (by putting your IP address
in the Remote IP field and clicking "CONNECT") ,you
can select a file and send it.
